            \item Press 1 to \emph{Start}. You will be prompted to pick a food number from 2-9. Hit enter, and the game begins! Move Pacman using W, A, S, and D, or visit the Tutorial from the menu to learn. You have to eat all the pieces before going to the door. Don’t miss one! Don’t hit a block or get out of the box! After a game, you can always play again.
