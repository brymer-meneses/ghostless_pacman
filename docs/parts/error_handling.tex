As seen in the algorithms, the game was programmed to handle errors of user
input by displaying wrong input reminders per various instances. To recall,
below is a list of these occurrences:\\
    \begin{itemize}[label={}]
        \item In Menu, the program displays a reminder when the user keypress is not `1', `2', `3', or `A'
        \item In the Game
            \begin{itemize}[label={}]
                \item In choosing the food number, the program displays a
                    reminder when the user chooses a number outside the range
                    from 2 to 9 \item In playing the game, the program displays
                    a reminder when the user presses keys other than `W', `S',
                    `A', or `D' to move Pacman, and when the user presses keys
                    other than `M' to return to menu or `X' to exit the game
                \item In choosing an option after the game results, displayed
                    through the game prompts, the program displays a reminder
                    when the user presses keys other than `R' to restart, `M'
                    to return to menu, or `X' to exit
            \end{itemize}
        \item In Tutorial
            \begin{itemize}[label={}]

                    user presses keys other than `←' or `→' to navigate through
                    the tutorial slides, or when the user presses keys other than
                    `M' to return to menu
                \item In the last slide, the program
                    displays a reminder when the user presses keys other than
                    `1' to start the game, `M' to return to menu, or `X' to
                    exit
